## 💰 COST ESTIMATE (For Third-Party Services)

**If using automated verification services:**

| Service | Purpose | Cost |
|---------|---------|------|
| **Twilio** | SMS OTP verification | ~$0.01 per SMS |
| **SendGrid** | Email notifications | Free (12k emails/month) |
| **Google Maps API** | Address validation | $5 per 1000 requests |
| **Stripe Identity** | ID verification (optional) | $1.50 per verification |
| **Checkr** | Background checks (optional) | $20-50 per check |

**Estimated monthly cost for 100 vendors:**

## ✅ FINAL RECOMMENDATION

**Implement 24-48 Hour Verification with Two Tiers:**

1. **Express (24 hours)**: Low-risk, complete applications
2. **Standard (48-72 hours)**: All others, high-risk, or incomplete

**This balances:**
- ✅ Vendor satisfaction (fast approval)
- ✅ Platform safety (proper vetting)
- ✅ Admin workload (manageable)
- ✅ Industry standards (competitive)
